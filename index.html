                            Novel from which Si Tjonat was adapted
                            Si Tjonat is a 1929 bandit film from the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia). The silent film was directed by Nelson Wong and produced by Wong and Jo Eng Sek. It was shot in black and white and starred Ku Fung May and Herman Sim. Based on the novel (cover pictured) by F. D. J. Pangemanann, it follows an indigenous man who flees to Batavia (today Jakarta) and becomes a bandit after killing his fellow villager. After kidnapping an ethnic Chinese woman, he is defeated and brought to justice. The story had proved popular with ethnic Chinese readers and was often adapted to the stage by Betawi troupes as a lenong stage performance, but the film received mixed reviews. Although it was intended as a serial, no sequel was ever made; the production house, Batavia Motion Picture, closed soon afterwards. Several works in the same genre as Si Tjonat were released, including Si Pitoeng in 1931, which used the same director and star. The film has probably been lost.

                        <p>There are 53 Grade I listed buildings in Sedgemoor, 14 of which are on Castle Street, Bridgwater. Sedgemoor is a local government district in the English county of Somerset. In the United Kingdom, the term listed building refers to a building or other structure officially designated as being of special architectural, historical or cultural significance; Grade I structures are those considered to be "buildings of exceptional interest". From 1723 to 1728, Castle Street was built on the site of the demolished Bridgwater Castle, as homes for the merchants trading in the town's port. Outside the town of Bridgwater, the largest concentration of Grade I listed buildings are in the village of Cannington, where the 12th-century Cannington Court and 14th-century St Mary's Church (pictured) were both associated with a Benedictine nunnery. Most of the Grade I listed buildings in Sedgemoor are Norman- or medieval-era churches, many of which are included in the Somerset towers, a collection of distinctive, mostly spireless Gothic church towers.

                            Parthenos sylvia, commonly known as the clipper, is a species of nymphalid butterfly found in forested areas of southern and southeastern Asia. This butterfly, photographed in Kerala, India, is puddling in a film of shallow water at the edge of a stream. Puddling is a behavior whereby butterflies, and some other insects, suck up fluids from mud, carrion, excrement, or rotting plant material, in order to fulfil their physiological needs for certain minerals and amino acids. When the conditions are suitable, butterflies commonly form conspicuous aggregations on wet soil, and some species are also attracted to body fluids such as sweat or tears.
